# Overview 
Welcome to the _COC_ wiki. Here we have gathered documents for _COC_ developers. We also offer a wide selection of YouTube video tutorials.

**About _COC_**
_COC_ is an online coding platform for everyone. You can **play, create, share** your own code. Coding is done using a brand-new language, [_ALC_](alc-1.0-white-paper). Espeically, _COC_ is optimized for game programming.

Let's start a simple tutorial:

# Get Started

* Type a sample code

```javascript
// 3D donut

fd(4) rt(90)
fd(4) rt(90)
fd(4) rt(90)
fd(4) rt(90)
```

* Run your code
> Click the sceen and press 'R' key.
> Or, open command box and type '/run'

* Save the code
> Click save button in the editor menu

# What's Next?

* [COC Plugin](coc-plugin) : baseline for executing and sharing your code
* [COC App](coc-app) : a collection of plugins
* [ALC](alc-1.0-white-paper) : a programming language for COC
